![image](image.png)


## ü§ñ Overview

This project implements an interactive AI chatbot using Anthropic's Claude model via the AnthropicVertex API. Built with Streamlit, it provides a user-friendly interface for engaging in conversations with the AI, uploading documents for context, and managing chat history.

## üåü Features

- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Engage in real-time conversations with Claude AI.
- **Document Upload**: Support for PDF, DOCX, and TXT files to provide context to the AI.
- **Conversation Management**: Save, load, and delete conversation histories.
- **Customizable AI Context**: Define the AI's role and purpose for each conversation.
- **Message Statistics**: View word and token counts for each message.
- **Copy Functionality**: Easily copy individual messages or entire conversations.
- **Stream Responses**: AI responses are streamed in real-time for a dynamic experience.
- **Stop Generation**: Ability to stop the AI's response generation mid-stream.

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Google Cloud Project with AnthropicVertex API enabled
- `credentials.json` file with your Google Cloud credentials

## üöÄ Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ssbaraar/GCPVertex-ClaudeChat-Pro.git
   
2. **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use venv\\Scripts\\activate
    
3. **Install the required packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Set up your credentials:**

   Place your credentials.json file in the project root directory. This file should contain your Google Cloud credentials with access to the AnthropicVertex API.

### 2. **Anthropic API (via AnthropicVertex)**
   - **Documentation**: Anthropic provides an API to interact with their Claude models. This can be integrated with Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform for enhanced scalability and security. Detailed information is available on the [Anthropic website](https://www.anthropic.com/news/google-vertex-general-availability).
   - **Vertex AI and Anthropic API Documentation**: Learn more about integrating and deploying Claude models with [Google Cloud Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs) and [Anthropic Vertex](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/anthropic-models).
   - **Tutorial**: While direct tutorials are less common, Google Cloud's [Vertex AI documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/quickstarts) can guide you through deploying and managing models like Claude on their platform.

### 3. **Google Cloud AI Platform**
   - **Documentation**: Google Cloud's Vertex AI is where you can deploy, manage, and scale your AI models. The [Vertex AI documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs) offers all the information you need, from setup to model deployment.
   - **Tutorial**: You can follow this [Google Cloud tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/quickstarts) for step-by-step instructions on how to set up your project and deploy models using Vertex AI.

### 4. **PyPDF2 (for PDF parsing)**
   - **Documentation**: [PyPDF2's GitHub repository](https://github.com/py-pdf/PyPDF2) contains the codebase and documentation. It's a pure Python library that you can use to extract text and metadata from PDF files.
   - **Tutorial**: A basic guide on using PyPDF2 can be found on [Real Python](https://realpython.com/pdf-python/).

### 5. **python-docx (for DOCX parsing)**
   - **Documentation**: The official documentation for [python-docx](https://python-docx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) explains how to manipulate .docx files, including reading, writing, and modifying them.
   - **Tutorial**: A good starting tutorial can be found on [Python Programming](https://pythonprogramming.net/reading-word-documents-python-docx-module/).

### 6. **pyperclip (for copy functionality)**
   - **Documentation**: Pyperclip is a simple cross-platform clipboard module for Python. The [Pyperclip documentation on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyperclip/) provides installation instructions and basic usage examples.

## üîç Code Structure
* app.py: Main application file containing the Streamlit interface and core logic.
* requirements.txt: List of Python package dependencies.
* .gitignore: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore..
## üîê Authentication

VertexClaude Pro uses a simple authentication system with a common password for all users. 

- **Default Password**: `claude2023`

To change the password:
1. Open the `app.py` file
2. Locate the `COMMON_PASSWORD` constant near the top of the file
3. Replace `"claude2023"` with your desired password
4. Save the file and restart the application

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: For production use, it's highly recommended to implement a more secure authentication system.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Google Cloud & Anthropic Setup

1. Ensure you have a Google Cloud project with Vertex AI API enabled
2. Create a service account with necessary permissions for Vertex AI
3. Download the service account key as `credentials.json`
4. Place `credentials.json` in the root directory of the project

### Model Configuration

You can adjust the AI model settings in the sidebar:
- Temperature
- Top-p (nucleus sampling)
- Max tokens

### Chatbot Role

Customize the chatbot's role and purpose using the "Define Chatbot Role" section in the sidebar.

## üìö Usage

1. Log in using your username and the common password
2. Start chatting with the AI assistant
3. Upload documents for context if needed
4. Adjust settings and explore features in the sidebar

## üß† AI Context

The AI uses a combination of:
- Recent conversation history
- Uploaded document content (if any)
- Custom role definition

This context is used to inform the AI's responses and maintain coherence throughout the conversation.

## üíæ Data Storage

Conversations and user data are stored in a SQLite database (`chatbot.db` by default). The application uses a connection pool for efficient database operations.

## üöÄ Deployment

For production deployment:
1. Set up a proper authentication system
2. Use environment variables for sensitive information
3. Consider using a more robust database system
4. Implement additional security measures as needed
